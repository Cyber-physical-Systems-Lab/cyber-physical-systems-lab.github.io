                                    We develop multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms and cooperative robot behaviors for complex robotic
                                    systems. Our research focuses on distributed decision-making, task allocation strategies, and adaptive learning
                                    mechanisms that enable robots to work together effectively in dynamic environments. We investigate coordination
                                    for warehouse automation, swarm robotics applications, and collaborative manipulation tasks where multiple robots
                                    must share resources and coordinate actions to achieve collective objectives. Our work combines theoretical
                                    advances in reinforcement learning with practical implementations in real robotic systems, addressing challenges
                                    such as communication constraints, partial observability, and scalable coordination in large robot teams.

                                    We explore biomimetic approaches to robot learning and design, with particular emphasis on soft robotics and
                                    haptic systems for wearable applications. Our research investigates how biological principles can inspire novel
                                    robotic mechanisms, cooperation strategies, and sensorimotor integration approaches. We focus on developing
                                    compliant robotic systems that can safely interact with humans, studying how sensors and actuators collaborate
                                    in soft robotic platforms. We investigate symbiotic relationships between biological principles and robotic
                                    systems, exploring how natural coordination mechanisms can inform multi-agent robot behaviors and how bio-inspired
                                    algorithms can enhance cooperation in cyber-physical systems.

                                    Our research addresses the complex challenges of designing robots that can naturally and effectively interact
                                    with humans in diverse social and cultural contexts. We focus on multimodal human-robot communication and socially
                                    aware navigation algorithms that respect human social norms. Our work encompasses both technical aspects of HRI
                                    (speech recognition, natural language processing, social signal processing) and psychological factors that influence
                                    human acceptance and trust in robotic systems. We study group dynamics in human-robot teams and develop methods for
                                    robots to adapt their behavior to different cultural contexts and social situations.

                                    We develop methodologies for creating fair, transparent, and accountable AI systems in robotics applications.
                                    Our research addresses the critical need for explainable AI in robotic decision-making, ensuring that autonomous
                                    systems can provide clear reasoning for their actions, especially in safety-critical scenarios. We investigate
                                    algorithmic fairness in robot behavior, developing techniques to prevent bias and discrimination in robotic systems
                                    that interact with diverse human populations. Our work includes designing verification and validation frameworks for
                                    AI-enabled robots, establishing metrics for measuring trustworthiness, and creating tools that help developers build
                                    more responsible robotic systems. We also explore the ethical implications of autonomous robot deployment and develop
                                    guidelines for responsible robotics research and development.

                                    next-generation robotic systems in a more human-centered and sustainable way. This interdisciplinary approach

                                    to envision and develop robotic technologies that address future societal needs. Our research includes developing

                                    creative problem-solving approaches for complex robotics challenges, and future scenario planning for robotics

                                    We investigate sustainable and resilient approaches to robotic system design, focusing on creating robots that
                                    can operate reliably in challenging environments while minimizing environmental impact throughout their lifecycle.
                                    Our research addresses both the sustainability aspects—including energy-efficient algorithms, resource optimization,
                                    and environmentally conscious robotics practices—and resilience aspects such as fault tolerance, adaptive behavior
                                    under uncertainty, and robust operation in dynamic conditions. We develop embedded control systems that balance
                                    performance with energy consumption, investigate renewable energy integration for autonomous mobile robots, and
                                    create frameworks for assessing both the environmental impact and operational resilience of robotic deployments.
                                    Our work includes developing embedded systems architectures that can adapt to failures and changing conditions,
                                    real-time control algorithms that maintain functionality under resource constraints, and methodologies for designing
