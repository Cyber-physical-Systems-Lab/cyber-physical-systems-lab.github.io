									<h3>Karin Johansson</h3>
								</header>
								<p>I believe playfulness is a key to a better future. I currently pursue a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction. My research focuses on
									designing for playful interactions in public spaces, together with value-driven stakeholders, such as municipalities, public real
									estate companies, and museums. I am especially passionate about social and cultural sustainability and how to design to enhance such
									values through playful innovation methods. Before my PhD I worked as a designer, artist, and educator, and I try to bring those
									perspectives into my research. I believe long coffee breaks are the key to breakthroughs.</p>
