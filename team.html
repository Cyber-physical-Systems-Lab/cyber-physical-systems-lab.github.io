                                <p>The Cyber-Physical Systems Lab proudly welcomes 5–10 master's thesis students each year as integral members of our research community.
                                    We value the fresh perspectives and enthusiasm these students bring to our work, creating a vibrant environment of mutual learning and
                                    discovery. Through close collaboration with our researchers, students engage in cutting-edge projects while developing their research skills
                                    and expertise. We're always excited to meet new students interested in joining our lab, and we encourage you to explore the diverse range of
                                    projects completed by our current and former students below. These projects showcase the breadth and depth of research opportunities available
                                    in our lab.</p>
